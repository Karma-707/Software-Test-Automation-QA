<b><p>How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?</b></p>
To ensure my code, program, and software is functional and secure; I created JUnit tests and error handling codes. This way it ensures the software does as planned and if it ever meets any unexpected results there would also be ways the error is handled without crashing the software.

<b><p>How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?</b></p>
I interpret user needs and incorporate them into the program by having the user list out their requirements and understanding them before implementing them in the program. After the implementation there will also be testing to ensure the requirements are met from the user side. 

<b><p>How do I approach designing software?</b></p>
I approached software designing by first understanding the requirements that are needed of me by the users. Next, I will come up with a plan and code according to the userâ€™s requirement by the side to ensure my program works as intended and expected.
